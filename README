Introduction
-----------------

This project engaged with analyzing data of NYC fire incident dispatch data.
The tasks for this project were to upload data to the opensearch and analyze it.
Then, we had to create visualization in order to illustrate patterns related to the data.

Requirments
-------------------

For this project there were some necessery requirments:
To include the variable incident_datetime.
At least one numeric and one categorical variable.
The data should be above 100k rows.
The script should react to the num_page and size_page and take into account an offset.
No null values.
Loading the data in bulks.

Instructions:
--------------------

In order to load the data, we need to use terminal and build docker.
Then, we need to docker run the following command line arguments:

docker run \
 -e DATASET_ID="8m42-w767" \
-e APP_TOKEN="5XqyRc84EVWawou1DP1Dum1Pc" \
-e ES_HOST="https://search-cis9760-hagay-ringel-7ziyrscwmjdg4c7s72555lipky.us-east-2.es.amazonaws.com" \
-e ES_USERNAME="**********" \
-e ES_PASSWORD="**********" \
-e INDEX_NAME="bigdata" \
requests:1.0 --page_size=  --numpages=

Next to the "page_size" and "numpages" fields, we need to insert the numbers of pages/rows we want to load.

The visualizatiuon:
----------------------

For this project, I created 5 visuals: 1 gauge and 4 regular visuals.
The gauge- Indicates the number of rows I loaded at this project- 5,429,532.
Visual #1- Show an overview of the incident classification in a pie by percentage.
Visual #2- Show the trend of each incident classification over a time frame of 10 years (2005-2015) in a way we can see trends.
Visual #3- This visual is a table that shows the average ladders used per incident per borough.
Visual #4- This visual is a bit more specific than the others, as it's a bar that indicates on the number of the incident: medical assist civilian,
per borough during 2020 (Covid-19 year).
